/ Hello k!
/ Actually, I have a question. Is there an easy way (or developer-intended at least, since nothing about k seems designed to be easy) to use latin symbolic constants in place of ∞, ø and other symbols that I can't find on my keyboard? If there is, it would be nice of you to include it in the article.

x:∞
x=x+1
